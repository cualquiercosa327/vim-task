 (3) It is unnecessary to go back (with "h") over a letter twice. To see this, we can consider the four possible cases for overlapping streaks of "h"es: (TODO: real images, side by side) (has anyone got a simpler proof?)

    <- hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh (implicit single "x"es interspersed)
   |
    ----------------> (some sequence of jumps)
                     |
          <- hhhhhhhhh
         |

 (Case 1: The second streak is contained within the first one.)


          <- hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
         |
          -------------> (some sequence of jumps)
                        |
    <- hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
   |

 (Case 2: The second streak both begins and ends before the first one.)


    <- hhhhhhh (implicit single "x"es interspersed)
   |
    -----------------------------> (some sequence of jumps)
                                  |
          <- hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
         |

 (Case 3: The second streak starts and ends after the first one.)


          <- hhhhhhh
         |
          -----------------------> (some sequence of jumps)
                                  |
     <- hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
    |

 (Case 4: The first streak is contained with the second one.)


In cases 1 and 4, we are moving backwards, which is disadvantageous by (1).

In case 2, we can simply leave out the jumps.

In case 3, there is no point to going back all the way *into* the first streak, we can simply stop where it begins.

Note that this includes even more special cases for kinds of jumps and backward movements, and is notably more trickier to code than the obvious dynamic programming approach.


--

types of tests:
- many consecutive "e"s, not at start (dunno about this)
- alternating
- random
- hard case ???
- maybe some english text
- special cases:
 * Par's aaaaaaeraaaaaaer
 * start with e
 * jump more than just one, combine with above


limits:

40 points: 200 (400 for forcing optimization for 10 points? seems reasonable)
70 points: 5000 (10000 for opt for 5 points?)
100 points: 80000

todo:

need to code bad solutions!
create runner script
